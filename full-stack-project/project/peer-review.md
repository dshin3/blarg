# Peer Review

Today you will get feedback from your classmates.
You will divide into pairs and evaluate one another's apps.
You do need to do some work ahead of time to prepare for this.

## Ahead of time

During job search portion of the curriculum, you will organize your search materials using Google Drive.
Create a Drive folder that is shared with App Academy.
We will work out of this folder to provide comments and feedback.

You will use your folder for the first time at the Full Stack Projects peer review workshop.
At the workshop, you and your peers will review one another's projects, and provide feedback.

Please prepare by working through the following instructions.

1. Create a new google folder named "Job search - [your name]"
2. Share the folder with "can edit" permissions to:  career-coaches@appacademy.io   (find these options under [Folder Name] > Share...)
3. Copy this document into your folder.
  [This spreadsheet][peer-review-spreadsheet] lists features that we will look for in your capstone projects, to help get the attention of employers.  
4. Make a second copy of the doc.
  You will have two peer reviewers in the workshop, and they will each need a copy.
  You will share these scoresheets with them to get feedback.
